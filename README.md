	So, this repository is my learning progress about C and also Git and Github, as I am a begginer to both of these three.
	I would tell you guys to not expect much from the codes you'll see above, because I am really beginner at C, and I am
	also learning how to better use Vim and Git.
	Please, if you have recommendations on how I can improve my code and make me a better programmer.
	Thanks for reading this, and have fun on your programming career :)
